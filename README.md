# Credit-Card-Defaulter-Prediction
A significant portion of a bank’s revenue comes from credit card operations, including interest charges, annual fees, and transaction commissions. However, customers who fail to make their credit card payments for an extended period can lead to substantial losses. In this dataset, clients labeled as “Yes” for default are those who did not pay their credit card dues within the specified grace period, while those labeled “No” made their payments on time. Issuing credit cards to customers with a higher likelihood of default represents increased risk for the bank. To mitigate this, banks often use risk-based pricing and other measures to balance profitability and exposure. Predictive modeling can help identify potential defaulters based on factors such as employment type, education level, account balance, existing loans, and home ownership. Understanding which characteristics are most strongly associated with default enables banks to make more informed and responsible credit decisions.
