# Credit-Card-Defaulter-Prediction
A major chunk of bank revenue is generated by credit cards. Customers who fail to pay their credit card dues on time could potentially cost banks a lot of revenue. The clients whose default value is Yes, means that they do not pay their credit card before the due time. While the clients whose default value is No, means that they successfully pay their credit card before the due time.
Issuing credit cards to customers who have a higher likelihood of not paying their dues on time involves higher risk for the bank. Issuing these customers cards with a higher interest rate would work in favor of the bank. Prediction can be done based on factors like job, education, balance, loans and house ownership.
Finding out which are the most common factors that defaulters have will also help the bank to be cautious before issuing a credit card to customers who falls into one those categories.
